## Tools
[discuss tools Ive used. Break them into categories. Ex. Network, SIEM, Attacks. ADD HYPERLINKS]
### Network
  #### Wireshark
  Completed a project to search for malicous spam emails. I was given a three PCAP file to analyze. I was able to find evidence of malicous emails by filtering the search to TCP.
  #### PFsense
  Foundational knowledge. Ive use this program to set up vpn via Virtual Machines
  #### Snort
  An HIDs program that I used for a project. The project mainly focused on installing and enabling Snort. Once Snort was enabled, I would launch a script to modify a file. 
### SIEM
  #### Splunk
  I used Splunk for multiple projects. The first project was about learning and utilizing it. I was given a Netflix dataset. The second project was about getting comfortable looking for specific data. The last project was a group project. We were given 
### Incident Response
  #### Catalyst
  Created a ticket. Then pretending to be an IT agent. Upon reading the ticket, I would look for signs of malicious use via Splunk. I was able to find evidence and documented what I found. The last thing i did add is how to mitigate this issue to prevent this from happening again.
